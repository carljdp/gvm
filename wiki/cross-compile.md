## Building CLI Executables for Windows and Linux with PyInstaller

PyInstaller can indeed build CLI executables for both Windows and Linux, but it needs to be run on the target platform to create a native executable. This means you need to build the executable on Windows to get a Windows-compatible executable and on Linux to get a Linux-compatible executable.

However, there are a few methods to achieve cross-platform builds:

### Method 1: Native Builds on Each Platform

1. **Build on Windows**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile src/gvm/main.py
   ```

2. **Build on Linux**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile src/gvm/main.py
   ```

### Method 2: Using Docker for Cross-Compilation

You can use Docker to create a cross-compilation environment. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use Docker to build a Linux executable on a Windows machine:

1. **Create a Dockerfile for Linux**:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim

   RUN pip install pyinstaller

   COPY . /app
   WORKDIR /app

   RUN pyinstaller --onefile src/gvm/main.py
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t pyinstaller-linux .
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/dist pyinstaller-linux
   ```

This will create the Linux executable in the `dist` directory on your host machine.

### Method 3: Using Wine for Windows Executables on Linux

You can use Wine to build Windows executables on a Linux machine:

1. **Install Wine**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install wine
   ```

2. **Install PyInstaller using Wine**:
   ```bash
   wine pip install pyinstaller
   ```

3. **Build the Windows Executable**:
   ```bash
   wine pyinstaller --onefile src/gvm/main.py
   ```

This will generate a Windows-compatible executable.
