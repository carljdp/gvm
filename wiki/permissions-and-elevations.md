# Cross-Platform Permissions and Elevations Reference

When writing cross-platform Python code, understanding how POSIX and Windows systems handle permissions and elevation is crucial. This guide provides a quick reference to ensure your code handles these concepts gracefully across both platforms.

## POSIX Systems (e.g., Linux)

In POSIX systems, elevation is handled using `sudo`.

### Key Concepts

1. **User ID (UID) and Permissions**:
   - Commands run with the root user's UID (0) when using `sudo`.
   - The user's UID is not used; it temporarily switches to the root user.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Requires the user's password for authentication.

3. **Temporary Privileges**:
   - Applies only to the command executed with `sudo`.
   - Returns to normal user privileges after execution.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - `sudo` resets environment variables by default.
   - Use the `-E` option to preserve them or configure `sudoers`.

### Example

```python
import os

# Check if running as root
if os.geteuid() == 0:
    print("Running with root privileges")
else:
    print("Running with user privileges")
```

## Windows Systems

In Windows, elevation is managed by User Account Control (UAC).

### Key Concepts

1. **User Account Control (UAC)**:
   - Elevates privileges using UAC.
   - Prompts for confirmation or administrator credentials.

2. **User and Process Token**:
   - Uses security tokens to grant administrative privileges.
   - The process retains the user's SID but gains additional privileges.

3. **Temporary Elevation**:
   - Applies only to the specific instance of the program.

4. **Environment**:
   - Similar to user environment but with administrative rights.

### Example

```python
import ctypes, os

def is_admin():
    try:
        return ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()
    except:
        return False

if is_admin():
    print("Running with administrative privileges")
else:
    print("Running with user privileges")
```

## Cross-Platform Implementation

When writing cross-platform scripts, use the following structure to handle permissions and elevations appropriately:

### Checking for Elevated Privileges

```python
import os
import ctypes

def is_elevated():
    if os.name == 'nt':
        # Windows check
        try:
            return ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()
        except:
            return False
    else:
        # POSIX check
        return os.geteuid() == 0

if is_elevated():
    print("Running with elevated privileges")
else:
    print("Running with user privileges")
```

## Handling Elevation

1. **POSIX Systems**:
   - Ensure scripts are run with `sudo` if required.
   - Preserve necessary environment variables.

2. **Windows Systems**:
   - Ensure UAC prompts for administrative privileges.
   - Handle security tokens and elevated rights appropriately.

## Summary

- **POSIX Systems**:
  - Use `sudo` for elevation.
  - Commands run with root UID.
  - Temporary privileges.

- **Windows Systems**:
  - Use UAC for elevation.
  - Processes run with administrative token.
  - Temporary privileges with user identity retained.

This structure helps in managing permissions and escalations, ensuring that your Python code handles these aspects seamlessly across both POSIX and Windows platforms.
